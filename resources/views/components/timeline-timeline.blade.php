        <p>The victim’s families have been the reason why Sewol had not been forgotten. They protested to the government by marching, shaving, fasting, petitioning, and so on. But the government responded by ignoring and even ridiculing them.
        <p>But they could not give up on their children. They wish for their misfortune to end at them and hope for a safer country for other children. They vowed to continue fighting for the truth and leave a chapter in the Korean history.</p>
        <p>They are still on their way to find the truth.<br>I will be with them until the truth is found.</p>
